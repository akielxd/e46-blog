summary: Planned to make it louder, ended up making it run again. Classic BMW — alternator out, fresh one in, back to changing headers soon.

What was supposed to be a simple day installing my catless headers turned into a bit of a detour. I went to start the car and… nothing. Completely dead.  

Turns out the alternator had been undercharging the battery for a while, and letting it sit definitely didn’t help. So, before I could think about more power mods, it was time to handle some good ol’ BMW maintenance.

I managed to source a **used OEM replacement** locally and got to work.

### Removal 
This isn’t a full DIY guide, but here’s the basic rundown if you’re doing this on an M54-powered E46:

1. Remove the **fan and intake** to access the front of the engine.  
2. Release tension and remove the **serpentine belt**.  
3. Remove the **idler pulley**.  
4. Unplug the **electrical connector** on the alternator.  
5. Remove the **17mm nut** holding the positive cable.  
6. Pull the alternator out — it may need a bit of wiggling.

Here's a proper [diy guide](https://www.pelicanparts.com/BMW/techarticles/BMW-3-Series-E46/56-ELEC-Alternator_Replacement/56-ELEC-Alternator_Replacement.htm) for this.

Once it’s out, take a second to admire your hard work and the big gap left behind.

### Installation
Reinstalling is as simple as reversing the steps. Make sure to torque everything properly and reconnect all electricals securely.  

While I was in there, I also replaced the **battery ground cable** — mine was corroded and overdue.

If you’ve read the [Catless Header Install](/posts/catless-headers), you already know this has been in the works.  
This time, we’re wrapping up the rest of the exhaust. Since most of the action happened under the car, there aren’t too many pictures to show.

### Learning to Weld

I picked up some 2.5 inch exhaust piping already bent to the car's shape and partially welded, part of the same deal as the catless headers. To finish it off, I bought a **resonator**, a **muffler**, and an **arc welder**, because why not learn something new while I’m at it?

I used **7018 fast-fill rods**, and was told they’d probably *blow right through* thin exhaust tubing.  

They did.  

But after a few test passes and some dial-in time, I started laying down welds that were far from pretty, but held up surprisingly well.

They’re definitely not perfect, kind of ironic since I joked about *questionable welds* when removing the stock exhaust. But for a **first attempt**, I’ll take it. Solid, sealed, and holding strong.

### Fitment & Finish

Mocking it up, I noticed a small mistake: the exhaust sat a bit too far to the right and was tapping the spare tire well. It’ll need to come back out for a few tweaks, but since it was already mounted, I figured I might as well get a sound test in.

Here’s how it sounded at that point (just a **resonator** and a **muffler**):

It’s a huge improvement over stock, that said, it was a bit **too loud and boomy** for my taste. I realized this was because both the resonator and muffler were straight-through designs, so I decided to swap in a **chambered muffler** to calm things down.

### Adjustments

Out the exhaust came again for another round of cutting, adjusting, and re-welding.  
This time, the fitment is spot-on and the sound is just right.  

I’ll admit — the welds still aren’t pretty, and the bends could be cleaner, but it’s **my work**, and I’m proud of it.  

Here’s how it sounds now with the added chambered muffler:

With the fitment dialed in and the tone finally to my liking, I can officially call this custom exhaust project **done**.

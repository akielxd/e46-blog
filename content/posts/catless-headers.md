You know those Marketplace deals that are *too good to pass up*?  
That’s exactly how this one started.  

A guy was selling **catless headers** and a **Y-pipe** for **$50** — total steal. Two hours of driving later, I was in the driveway, tools in hand, ready to get to work.  

To make it even better, the seller threw in a **single-exit setup**, already bent and welded. All it needs is a few **resonators** and a **muffler**, and it’ll be perfect.

### Removal 

![engine bay](/images/catless-headers/engine-bay.png)

Here’s the starting point. My **windshield washer reservoir** and **SAP pump** were already deleted, which honestly made life easier as both would’ve needed to come out anyway to clear the headers.  

After jacking up the car, I started where the **headers meets the rest of the exhaust**, four rusty bolts that definitely put up a fight. I managed to remove them all without cutting, but two broke in the process.

Next, I moved toward the **mid-section bracket**, which holds the exhaust with **rubber hangers**. Pretty cool design, hadn’t seen it done like this before. With the bracket off and rear hangers unhooked, the entire system slid right out. Heavier than I expected, but it wasnt too bad.

The car already had a **muffler delete** setup with some sketchy welds now I’m 90% sure of where the high-pitched whistle was coming from.

Surpisingly the the *hardest* part of this whole job, was getting the header off the engine block. The top bolts were manageable, but the **bottom ones?** Nightmare.

Had to **remove the passenger-side engine mount and bracket** just to reach them. But after a bit of struggling they finally came free.

### Installing the New Setup

I decided to reuse the OEM gaskets but added alayer of [**Permatex Ultra Copper**](https://www.autozone.com/sealants-glues-adhesives-and-tape/sealant/p/permatex-ultra-copper-rtv-silicone-high-temperature-gasket-maker-3-oz/554048_0_0?spps.s=5331&cmpid=LIA:US:EN:AD:NL:1000000:GEN:22350391884&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22356757832&gbraid=0AAAAADkcoVsegcncOv1Xw2Yn3XZlvFOhR&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a5EKqP7DqWm470hI9x0vxhv9K3KZTGJdoEr-5ha0WFDr0KE13l1N04aAhlEEALw_wcB) gasket maker for some extra sealing confidence.  

This time around, things went a lot smoother — more space to work with and better access for a decent ratchet. The only hiccup was remembering exactly how the **engine mount** came out so I could get it back in correctly.  

While I was in there, I swapped the mount out entirely — it was completely split in half. I had a feeling it was bad and order one ahead of time.

All in I'd say this was worse than I expected but still not that bad of an install.

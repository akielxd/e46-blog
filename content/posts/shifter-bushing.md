I got tired of feeling like I was **stirring soup every time I shifted**, so it‚Äôs time to tighten things up.  
Today‚Äôs job: replacing the **worn-out shifter bushings**, a relatively simple but satisfying install. Let‚Äôs get to it.

### Parts Used

I‚Äôm running the [Garagistic Shifter Rebuild Kit](https://www.garagistic.com/products/e46-325-318-323-316-320-shifter-bushing-kit?variant=40293692964963), which includes:

- Polyurethane rear carrier bushing  
- Aluminum round shifter bushings  
- OEM shifter cup  
- OEM front carrier clip

### Removal

First things first, we‚Äôre going **under the car**.  
If yours leaks oil like mine did, you‚Äôll be greeted with some *premium baked-on grime*. At least it keeps the rust away, right?

After pulling the **exhaust, heat shield, and driveshaft**, the shifter assembly is in full view:

Getting it out wasn‚Äôt too bad, but the front carrier clip (affectionately known as the *‚Äúbitch clip‚Äù*) definitely lived up to its name. Thankfully, the kit included a new one since the old clip didn‚Äôt survive removal.  

Once everything was out, I gave it a quick clean before installing the new bushings.

### Installation

With all the new parts ready, it was time to throw everything back in.  

With the **aluminum round bushings** it was a super tight fit, lining it up so the front carrier clip could slide through was a bit of a fight. Once that was in, I got starter the rear carrier bushing. It needed a few gentle persuasion taps with a hammer (maybe more than a few), but it all came together cleanly in the end.

Since the exhaust is out for a custom set up **(post coming soon)**, I decided to address the shifter slop I've been dealing with. 

Today‚Äôs job: replacing the **worn-out shifter bushings**, a relatively simple but satisfying install. Let‚Äôs get to it.

I‚Äôm using the [**Garagistic Shifter Rebuild Kit**](https://www.garagistic.com/products/e46-325-318-323-316-320-shifter-bushing-kit?variant=40293692964963), which includes:

- Polyurethane rear carrier bushing  
- Aluminum round shifter bushings  
- OEM shifter cup  
- OEM front carrier clip

### Removal

First things first, we‚Äôre going **under the car**.  
If yours leaks oil like mine did, you‚Äôll be greeted with some *premium baked-on grime*.

As mentioned before the exhaust is already out so the only things in the way are the **heat shield**, and **driveshaft**. With those removed the shifter assembly is in full view:

Getting it out wasn‚Äôt too bad, but the front carrier clip (affectionately known as the *‚Äúbitch clip‚Äù*) definitely lived up to its name. Thankfully, the kit included a new one since the old clip didn‚Äôt survive removal.  

Once everything was out, I gave it a quick clean before installing the new bushings.

### Installation

With all the new parts ready, it was time to throw everything back in.  

With the **aluminum round bushings** it was a super tight fit, lining it up so the front carrier clip could slide through was a bit of a fight. Once that was in, I got starter the rear carrier bushing. It needed a few gentle persuasion taps with a hammer (maybe more than a few), but it all came together cleanly in the end.

Overall, the shifter feels much firmer now, but there‚Äôs still a bit of side-to-side play, mostly coming from the shifter rod. I‚Äôll eventually install a dual-shear shifter rod to take care of that, but for now, it‚Äôs a huge improvement over before.

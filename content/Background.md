summary: "The story of my BMW E46 project, why I chose it, and where it's headed."

Ever since selling my **E36 convertible** and moving into a more modern BMW, an **F30 330i**, I’ve found myself missing that classic straight-six BMW character. So, I went searching on Facebook Marketplace and came across this 2004 325Ci.

It wasn’t my first choice, but with a tight budget and the usual Marketplace sellers who don’t like to respond, I went for it. It had been in an accident, the interior was falling apart, the water pump was leaking, and there were plenty of oil leaks, classic BMW problems.

## Early repairs
The car was only about 30 minutes from home, but it ended up being a 1.5-hour trip thanks to a leaking cooling system that had me stopping constantly to top up water. I figured it wasn’t worth calling a tow truck, maybe not the smartest choice, but somehow it made it home in one piece.

Once I made it home, I got to work. I ordered a handful of critical cooling system parts and knocked them out over the following days:

- Serpentine belt
- Metal housing thermostat
- Water pump (and a metal pulley)
- Hydraulic tensioner
- Idler pulley
- Expansion tank

## Drift phase
Not long after getting it running reliably, I picked up a welded diff and tossed it in. The car spent a few weekends going sideways, which was fun, until I realized I actually wanted to take it in the opposite direction: turn it into a clean street car.

So the focus shifted. I started addressing the visual and structural issues that had been bothering me since day one.

The body had damage from a previous accident, and while most of it could be pulled and straightened, it turns out the rear frame is bent. That’s when I decided to cut it out entirely and build a tube-frame rear end.

Still, I managed to pull some of the damage out enough to realign the trunk and tail light. I picked up what I thought was a color-matched trunk lid - close, but the shade was slightly off. Still, I swapped it in along with a replacement passenger-side tail light to clean things up a bit.

That brings things up to where it stands now. A bit of a mix between drift scars and restoration ambition. The long-term plan? Keep bringing it back to life, step by step.
